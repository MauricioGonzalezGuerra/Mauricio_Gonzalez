0,0,1,Portugal,"This is ripe and fruity, a wine that is smooth while still structured. Firm tannins are filled out with juicy red berry fruits and freshened with acidity. It's  already drinkable, although it will certainly be better from 2016.",Avidagos,87,15,Douro,Roger Voss,Quinta dos Avidagos 2011 Avidagos Red (Douro),Portuguese Red,Quinta dos Avidagos
1,1,2,US,"Pineapple rind, lemon pith and orange blossom start off the aromas. The palate is a bit more opulent, with notes of honey-drizzled guava and mango giving way to a slightly astringent, semidry finish.",Reserve Late Harvest,87,13,Michigan,Alexander Peartree,St. Julian 2013 Reserve Late Harvest Riesling (Lake Michigan Shore),Riesling,St. Julian
2,2,3,US,"Much like the regular bottling from 2012, this comes across as rather rough and tannic, with rustic, earthy, herbal characteristics. Nonetheless, if you think of it as a pleasantly unfussy country wine, it's a good companion to a hearty winter stew.",Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block,87,65,Oregon,Paul Gregutt,Sweet Cheeks 2012 Vintner's Reserve Wild Child Block Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley),Pinot Noir,Sweet Cheeks
3,3,4,Spain,"Blackberry and raspberry aromas show a typical Navarran whiff of green herbs and, in this case, horseradish. In the mouth, this is fairly full bodied, with tomatoey acidity. Spicy, herbal flavors complement dark plum fruit, while the finish is fresh but grabby.",Ars In Vitro,87,15,Northern Spain,Michael Schachner,Tandem 2011 Ars In Vitro Tempranillo-Merlot (Navarra),Tempranillo-Merlot,Tandem
4,4,5,Italy,"Here's a bright, informal red that opens with aromas of candied berry, white pepper and savory herb that carry over to the palate. It's balanced with fresh acidity and soft tannins.",Belsito,87,16,Sicily & Sardinia,Kerin Oâ€™Keefe,Terre di Giurfo 2013 Belsito Frappato (Vittoria),Frappato,Terre di Giurfo
